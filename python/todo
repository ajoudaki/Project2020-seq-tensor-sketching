# TODO LIST

- Measure shift distance between low-edit-distance minimizer-matches
- Is Hamming distance embedding good enough maybe?
	- What if we add minimizers + their right neighbour, to account for small distances?
- Analyse different minimizer strategies and what distribution of minimizer offsets/distances they give [depending on mutation rate/window size/kmer size]
- Implement edit distance embedding?
- Implement hamming distance embedding?
